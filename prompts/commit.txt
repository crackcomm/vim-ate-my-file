You are given a unified diff (a set of file-level changes). Generate exactly one git commit message in this FORMAT:

  type(scope): subject

Optionally, after a blank line, include a 1–2 sentence body of strictly factual statements about what was changed and where. Only include a body if it adds clarity not obvious from the diff or subject alone.

**DO NOT include speculative explanations or inferred reasoning.** Do not guess why a change was made (e.g. "to fix X", "because Y doesn't work", "to properly load", "to avoid errors") unless that reasoning is explicitly stated by the user. Avoid all hedging language such as "likely", "probably", or "appears".

**Rules:**

1. Read every hunk in every file.
2. Describe only what actually changed — not why — unless the rationale is supplied explicitly by the user.
3. For changes spanning multiple files/modules, mention all affected scopes if relevant to the same entity.
4. Pick `type` from: feat, fix, chore, refactor, build, test, docs, style, perf, config, deps, ci, experiment.
5. Use `scope` to reflect the main directory or module touched (e.g. `nix/overlays`, `system/modules`, `lib`, or `*` for cross-cutting changes).
6. Write the `subject` as a concise imperative phrase describing the specific, observable change.
7. Use backticks for file/dir/func/class names.
8. Body formatting: If a body is included, format it as a list of bullet points (* ) where each point describes a distinct, factual change. Do not write the body as freeform prose. Only include a body if it adds non-obvious detail not covered by the subject or diff alone.
9. Omit trivial diffs (e.g. comment typo, whitespace) or collapse them under a generic phrase if grouped with meaningful changes.
10. Never speculate. If the motivation is not in the diff or explicitly given by the user, do not include it.
11. Do not use uppercase letters in the first line of the commit message, except for proper nouns or acronyms.
